cmd-line options:
    -h <dbhost>
        connect to <dbhost> host
    -d <dbname>
        connect to <dbname> DB
    -U <dbuser>
        connect by <dbuser> user
    -L filename
    --log-file=filename
        Write all query output into file filename, in addition to the normal output destination.
    -v assignment
    --set=assignment
    --variable=assignment
        Perform a variable assignment, like the \set meta-command. Note that you must separate name and value, if any, by an equal sign on the command line. To unset a variable,
        leave off the equal sign. To set a variable with an empty value, use the equal sign but leave off the value. These assignments are done during a very early stage of start-up,
        so variables reserved for internal purposes might get overwritten later.


$ psql "service=myservice sslmode=require"

\?
    help
\q
    quit
\r or \reset
    Resets (clears) the query buffer.
\l[+] or \list[+] [ pattern ]
    List the databases in the server and show their names, owners, character set encodings, and access privileges.
    If pattern is specified, only databases whose names match the pattern are listed.
    If + is appended to the command name, database sizes, default tablespaces, and descriptions are also displayed.
    (Size information is only available for databases that the current user can connect to.)
\du[S+] [ pattern ]
    Lists database roles.
    (Since the concepts of “users” and “groups” have been unified into “roles”, this command is now equivalent to \dg.)
    By default, only user-created roles are shown; supply the S modifier to include system roles.
    If pattern is specified, only those roles whose names match the pattern are listed.
    If the form \du+ is used, additional information is shown about each role; currently this adds the comment for each role.
\dn[S+] [ pattern ]
    Lists schemas (namespaces).
    If pattern is specified, only schemas whose names match the pattern are listed.
    By default, only user-created objects are shown;
    supply a pattern or the S modifier to include system objects.
    If + is appended to the command name, each object is listed with its associated permissions and description, if any.
\dE[S+] [ pattern ]
\di[S+] [ pattern ]
\dm[S+] [ pattern ]
\ds[S+] [ pattern ]
\dt[S+] [ pattern ]
\dv[S+] [ pattern ]
    In this group of commands, the letters E, i, m, s, t, and v stand for foreign table, index, materialized view, sequence, table, and view, respectively. You can specify any or
    all of these letters, in any order, to obtain a listing of objects of these types. For example, \dit lists indexes and tables. If + is appended to the command name, each
    object is listed with its physical size on disk and its associated description, if any. If pattern is specified, only objects whose names match the pattern are listed. By
    default, only user-created objects are shown; supply a pattern or the S modifier to include system objects.
