??? how long does it took historically for this model??
If in 10 sec - need to run again
- monitor memory consumption during the run

- look for all the model: in _catRef:
- model1
- model1
- classify all the ref-d models one by one

??? recursion hypothesis
!!! notify support to take permission to classify !!!
