Characteristics:
SIZED
SUBSIZED
SORTED
ORDERED
DISTINCT
NONNULL
IMMUTABLE
CONCURRENT

characterized by Spliterator
.trySplit()

.boxed()
    ???

.sorted()
    full-barier operation (downstream ops can't start until this one ends)
.skip() and .limit()
    does not preserve the stream size :(
    .sublis() - is more effective
    .parallell() stream really utilize Spliterator and do a HUGE perf-boost
