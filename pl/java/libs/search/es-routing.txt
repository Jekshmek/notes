Routing fields

We only need to provide the routing parameter during querying. To do that, we need to add the following section to our type definition:

{
  "mappings" : {
    "post" : {
      "_routing" : { 
        "required" : true,
        "path" : "userId"
      },
      "properties" : {                
        ...
	}
    }
}

The routing value needs to be provided (the "required": true property); without it, an index request will fail.
In addition to that we specified the path attribute, which decides which field value of the document will be used as the routing value (userId in our case).
