Apache Kafka support

Spring Boot 1.5 include auto-configuration support for Apache Kafka via the spring-kafka project.
To use Kafka simply include the spring-kafka`depenency and configure the appropriate `spring.kafka.* application properties.

Recieving messages from Kafka is as simple as annotating a method:

@Component
public class MyBean {
    @KafkaListener(topics = "someTopic")
    public void processMessage(String content) {
        // ...
    }
}
