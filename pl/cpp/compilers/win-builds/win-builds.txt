Download the yypkg binaries and extract them into the home directory of MSYS/Cygwin:
  for MSYS: C:/win_builds/msys/1.0/home/[your_account_name]
  for Cygwin: C:/Cygwin/home/[your_account_name] 

Note

If you want to update packages later on, you will need the content of the archive.

    In the MSYS/Cygwin prompt, enter the directory where you’ve extracted the yypkg binaries (typically win-builds-bundle) and run one of:

    ./msys-cygwin-install.sh x86_64

    Check gcc is running well:

    gcc --version

    Set a default toolchain (optional):

    echo '. win-builds-switch.sh 64' >> ~/.profile
    echo '. win-builds-switch.sh 32' >> ~/.profile

3. Change toolchain on-the-fly

The win-builds-switch.sh script takes care of everything; run it in your shell like:

# To switch to the x86_64 toolchain
. win-builds-switch.sh 64
# To switch to the i686 toolchain
. win-builds-switch.sh 32
