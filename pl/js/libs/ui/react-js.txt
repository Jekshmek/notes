Important:
React - Flux + Redux by Denys Kuzin

Properties aren't intended to be changed - redrow everething
State - intended to be changed

Lifecycle (Initial Render, Props Change, State Change, Component Unmount)

!!! a lot of obsolete stuff !!!
Mixins are deprecated (according to the ES6)

Smart and dump components

data flows down
events flows up

top-level component is [not-visual] acts likes a controller

Flux is a save 3-weel MVC
one-way events is a normal, non-revolutional
