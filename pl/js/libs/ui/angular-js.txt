Separation of concerns

And all of the above tie into this over-arching theme: keep your concerns separate.

Your view acts as the official record of what is supposed to happen (for the most part);
your model represents your data;
you have a service layer to perform reusable tasks;
you do DOM manipulation and augment your view with directives;
and you glue it all together with controllers.

This was also mentioned in other answers, and the only thing I would add pertains to testability, which I discuss in another section below.
