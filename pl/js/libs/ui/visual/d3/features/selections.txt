d3.select
    #id
        by id

Another reason selections arenâ€™t literally arrays of elements is that they are arrays of arrays of elements:
    a selection is an array of groups, and each group is an array of elements

data binding
https://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/#data
Data is bound to elements one of several ways:
    Joined to groups of elements via selection.data.
    Assigned to individual elements via selection.datum.
    Inherited from a parent via append, insert, or select. 

However, unlike the other selection methods,
    selection.data defines data per-group rather than per-element: 
    data is expressed as an array of values for the group, or a function that returns such an array.

For selections with only a single group, you can pass the corresponding single array to selection.data directly;
you only need a function when binding different data to different groups.
