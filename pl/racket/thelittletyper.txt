notes
expressions, that describe other expressions, such as Atom, are called types

A form of judgement is an observation with blank spaces in it:
1. ___ is a ___
2. ___ is the same ___ as ___
3. ___ is a type
4. ___ and ___ are the same types

Judgements are acts of knowing, and
believing is part of knowing

Some forms of judgement only make sense after an earlier judgement (pre-supposition)

The normal [form] of an expression is the most direct way of writing it
    Sameness is always according to a type

Sameness is always according to a type, so normal forms are also determined by a type

Normal forms of types:
Every expression that is a type has a normal form,
which is the most direct way of writing that type.
If two expressions are the same type,
then they have identical normal forms,
and if two types have identical normal forms,
then they are the same types
    - expr is a ___  (expr has a type of ___)
