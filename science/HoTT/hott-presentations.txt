A Homotopy is a path between a path - that is, an equality of two equivalences
- Think of a piece of string attached at two end points
A path between a path is still a path
- Homotopies can have homotopies!
- Homotopies over homotopies over homotopies over homotopies over ...
This infinite tower of homotopies endows types with what is called an omega-groupoid structure,
  trivially generated with refl
But remember, refl isn't the only constructor for the identity type!
