git config --global rerere.enabled = true
    rerere - reuse recorded resolution

git log ..master

git rebase master

    resolve the conflicts, if any, ...


another usage of rebase is history manipulation

git rebase -i <commit-final>
    start interactive rebase (and specify commit to squish into).

    stage 1 - edit a stuff in editor:

    pick <id1> log1
    pick <id2> log2
    squash <idN>
    pick <id3> log3

    pick
        leave as is
    squash
        keep the commit message, merge the commit output
    <delete the line>
        drop the commit from the history (graph), but we can 

    # Rebase <id-start>..<id-end> onto <commit-final>


    stage 2 - edit the cummulative note
        Note: everything started from # will be ignored
