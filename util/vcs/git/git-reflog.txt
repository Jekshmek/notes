The reflog also shows a history, but it doesn’t show connections between commits.
It shows a local undo history of where HEAD has been.

If we make a commit to the master branch,
the value of .git/refs/heads/master
will change.
If we checkout another branch, the value of
.git/HEAD will change.
Every branch, tag, and other decoration
is just a reference to the ID of a specific
commit (calculated with SHA, the secure
hash algorithm).
