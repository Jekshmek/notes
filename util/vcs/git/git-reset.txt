UNSTAGING
git reset HEAD file
  rollback the indexation
git rm --cached database.yml
  remove from staging, leaving it at work-dir (to be added to .gitignore later)


git reset HEAD <file>
  rollback the <file> to a HEAD (current committed branch rev) state

git reset <commit>
  reset to commit
  result in a new dirty wrk dir in unsaved state
  undo a commit
  
  use get checkout -- <file>
    to compeletely remove <file>
