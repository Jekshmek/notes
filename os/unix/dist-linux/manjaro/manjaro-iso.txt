Gnome is currently a community edition with no maintainer.
However you can download manjaro-tools-iso and the current profiles from our master branch and give it a try yourself by building a ISO:

sudo pacman -S manjaro-tools-iso
mkdir ~/dev
cd ~/dev
git clone https://github.com/manjaro/manjaro-tools-iso-profiles.git
sudo buildiso -p gnome -qv
sudo buildiso -p gnome

It may or may not give you a proper result.
You may want to edit /etc/manjaro-tools/manjaro-tools.conf and copy it over to ~/.config/manjaro-tools/.
Also take a look at the profile.conf of the gnome profile.
