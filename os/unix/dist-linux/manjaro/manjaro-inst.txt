--- Package conflict issue:

pacman -Syuu

y = Only download database files if the remote repo webserver says it's changed since last time
yy = Download the databases even if the remote repo webserver says the files haven't changed since last time
u = Update packages to newer versions from the repo, but do not install packages from the repo that are an older version than the currently installed version (i.e. no downgrades)
uu = Match the versions of packages installed on the system to those present in the remote repo, even if it means downgrading to an apparently earlier package version

If you get distorted sound in skype, try adding PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 to your
env before starting skype. Something like 'export PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60' in .bashrc, for example.
