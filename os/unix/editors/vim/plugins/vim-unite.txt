Candidate list masks:

*hisa
    This example matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa.

**/foo
    This example would matche bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.
    Two consecutive wild cards recursively match directories.

Note: The unite action |file_rec| (read: file recursive) does a recursive
file search by default without the need to set wildcards.

foo bar
foo|bar
    This example matches "foobar" and "foobazbar", but not "foobaz"
    Multiple keywords can be be use to narrow down the candidates. They are separated by either a space " " or a pipe "|", and act like a logical AND.

foo !bar
    This example matches candidates that contain "foo" but not "bar".
    Specify negative conditions with a bang "!".

" Jump to line 3.
foo :3
" Search to "bar".
foo :/bar
" Executes :diffthis command.
foo :diffthis
    Specify command execution after the action with a ":".
    See |unite_default_key_mappings| for other actions.
