http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/256/is-it-good-to-make-a-separate-partition-for-boot

The main reason for the major enterprisey distro's like Red Hat and I think Suse to use a separate /boot is that they use LVM by default and Grub cannot be used to boot from LVM.
It is that simple.

So if you want to use LVM, and that is a boon, you use a separate /boot.
Personally, I think it is good practice to use both LVM and separate partitions for a host of things, like /var, /boot, /home and /tmp and even /usr on servers,
for example in order to protect your root filesystem or data partitions from getting full.
