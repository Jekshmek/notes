This errors is from replacing by pacman DLLs and EXEs that in use during 
update. You need restart MSYS2 after this errors.
I prefer the next update scenario.
pacman -Sy
pacman -Su —ignoregroup base
pacman -Su

otherwise:

This problem is probably due to using incompatible versions of the msys DLL.
Search for msys-2.0.dll using the Windows Start->Find/Search facility
and delete all but the most recent version.  The most recent version *should*
reside in x:\msys\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which you have
installed the msys distribution.  Rebooting is also suggested if you
are unable to find another msys DLL.
